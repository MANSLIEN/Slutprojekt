			Instead of studying individual subjects in
			isolation, you acquire the skills directly by using them on game projects.
			You will first become an apprentice, completing carefully designed game coding
			missions that will build your programming knowledge step-by-step. You will then
			extend these foundations by learning advanced concepts while creating your own
			games. Applying project management strategies will help you prototype your ideas
			and polish the end result to share your games with the world.
			On the art side of things you will choose any visual style that you want for your
			games. A study plan personalized for your goals will guide you through the art
			fundamentals and technical aspects required to bring your vision to life. Be it pixel
			art, 3D, traditional drawing, or digital painting, we have you covered.
